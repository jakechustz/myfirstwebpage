    <h1>Real Numbers vs. Imaginary numbers</h1>
    <h2 class="intro">Today's overview</h2>
      <p class="intro">We're gonna be learning about math. more specifically, real numbers. By definition, any whole number is a rational number (in particular zero is a rational number.)
          You can add, subtract, multiply and divide any pair of rational numbers and the result will again be a
          rational number (provided you don’t try to divide by zero).
          One day in middle school you were told that there are other numbers besides the rational numbers, and
          the first example of such a number is the square root of two. It has been known ever since the time of the
          greeks that no rational number exists whose square is exactly 2.</p>
      <p class="intro">Of course you can never write all the digits in the decimal expansion, so you only write the first few digits
          and hide the others behind dots. To give a precise description of a real number (such as 2) you have to
          explain how you could in principle compute as many digits in the expansion as you would like. During the
          next three semesters of calculus we will not go into the details of how this should be done.</p>

    <p>Why are real numbers called real? All the numbers we will use in this first semester of calculus are
        “real numbers.” At some point (in 2nd semester calculus) it becomes useful to assume that there is a number
        whose square is −1. No real number has this property since the square of any real number is positive, so
        it was decided to call this new imagined number “imaginary” and to refer to the numbers we already have
        (rationals, √2-like things) as “real.”</p>
    <p>Unfortunately we would soon discover that there don’t seem to be any rational numbers which, when squared, are exactly 2. Let us call x = √2 (the square root of 2). If we can’t find this new number among the rational numbers it must belong to some group of numbers we have not discovered yet. Let us call these new numbers the irrational numbers.
      Irrational numbers are those numbers which can’t be written as fractions. But how do we know that irrational numbers exist at all and that √2 is one of them? Maybe we just need to look harder to find a fraction which, when squared, is 2?
      Below is a proof to show that √2 is irrational. We shall first assume that √2 is rational and can be written as a fraction. Then we do a few logical operations and deduce something that can’t possibly be right: a contradiction. If all our steps were valid, this means that the assumption we started with, that √2 is rational, must be wrong. And then we know that√2 is indeed irrational.</p>    
    <p>Now we know that these irrational numbers do exist, and we even have one example: √2. It turns out that most other roots are also irrational. The constants π and e are also irrational.
      Just like rational numbers have repeating decimal expansions (or finite ones), the irrational numbers have no repeating pattern. Together, the irrational and rational numbers are called the real numbers which are often written as R. These are all numbers we can see along the number line.</p>
    <p>If we combine real and imaginary numbers, like in 2 + 3i, we get complex numbers. These are best represented in a coordinate system were the x-axis shows the real part and the y-axis shows the imaginary part of the complex number. This is called the Complex plane or Argand diagram, named after the mathematician Jean-Robert Argand (1768 – 1822).</p>
