      <div class="aboutme">
        <p>Led by the bright, nimble voice of group founder<span class="name"> Nicholas Petricca</span>, spirited and quirky 
          indie rockers <span class="name">WALK THE MOON</span> emerged from Cincinnati, Ohio with their first alternative hit, 
          <span class="song">Anna Sun</span>, in 2012. They went from popular to ubiquitous courtesy of their international hit 
          <span class="song">Shut Up and Dance</span>. It was taken from the group's third full-length, the platinum-selling 
          2014 release <span class="album">Talking Is Hard</span>, which reached a high of 14 on the Billboard 200. In 2017, they 
          returned with their fourth proper album and third for RCA, <span class="album">What If Nothing</span>. 
          Included on the album was the single <span class="song">One Foot</span>, their second U.S. Hot 100 single. 
          They embarked on the Press Restart Tour that November, wrapping it up in the U.K. 
          the following April. <span class="name">WALK THE MOON</span> was featured on the <span class="name">Morgxn</span> track <span class="song">Home</span> later in the year, 
          returning with another effervescent single of their own, <span class="song">Timebomb</span>, in early 2019.</p>
