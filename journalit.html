      <p><span class="dates">10/21:</span>Oh babe Know you tryna do you But I heard you fell off After couple bad nights 
        And twenty cold hearts Mmm Tryna find the new you But I heard you got lost Tryna 
        figure your worth What the hell does that cost? Ay When I'm kissing you, gripping your thigh
        I realize you were destined and meant to be mine But who I am to conflict with you living 
        your life? Just know when you call I'm at the end of the line I'll practice my patience
        While you're getting wasted Till fate brings you home I'll wait through your phases
        You'll shuffle through faces Like songs in your playlist Till fate brings you home
        I'll wait through your phases, phases, oh</p>
      <p><span class="dates">10/22:</span>span I feel a little nauseous and my hands are shaking I guess that means you're close by
          My throat is getting dry and my heart is racing I haven't been by your side
          In a minute, but I think about it sometimes Even though I know it's not so distant
          Oh, no, I still wanna reminisce it I think of that night in the park, it was getting dark
          And we stayed up for hours What a time, what a time, what a time
          You clinged to my body like you wanted it forever What a time, what a time, what a time
          For you and I What a time, what a time For you and I</p>
      <p><span class="dates">10/23:</span> What do you mean? I'm sorry by the way I'm never coming back down
          Can't you see I could but wouldn't stay? I wouldn't put it like that
          What do you mean? I'm sorry by the way I'm never coming around
          It'd be so sweet if Things just stayed the same
          La-da-da-da-da All the lights couldn't put out the dark
          Running through my heart Lights up and they know who you are
          Know who you are Do you know who you are?
          (Shine) Step into the light (Shine) So bright sometimes (Shine)
          I'm not ever going back</p>
